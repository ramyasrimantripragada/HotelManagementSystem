# HotelManagementSystem
The main aim of this project is to manage a hotel in an easiest way possible. The program is
written in a simple manner along with the comments wherever required, so that the user can
easily understand the procedure happening in the code. Menu-driven practice is adapted in
order to make the program more efficient and clear-cut.  The program initially displays main menu to the user :
I) Book a room (to make a booking)
II) Customer record (to display the customer details of a particular room)
III) Rooms allotted (to display the details of all the allotted rooms)
IV) Edit record (to edit or delete a record)
V) Exit (to exit the menu)
Basing on the option chosen by the user from option 1-4, the program will give the required
output and again displays the menu. The program continuously interacts with the user till the
user chooses Exit option.  Files concept is also used in order to store the files for present and future use
